# About
Poker bro is an app that lets you play LAN poker with your friends. Currently, app supports gameplay, where server is
just a synchronizer, not source of truth.
# Support
PokerBro works on desktop (JVM) and on android. IOS is not currently available.
# Launch
I strongly suggest using IntelliJ, especially for using on the phone.

For the game to install on your device, you need to connect the phone
either by cable or by Wi-Fi to IntelliJ. For whichever option you choose, you need to 
have developer's options and installing on through chosen option.

The app targets jvm-22, also you need to have firewall permissions for both private and public networks for your java.exe.
To run on desktop: `./gradlew run`
